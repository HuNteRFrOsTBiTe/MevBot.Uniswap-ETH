## <div align="center">🤖 M.E.V is a bot crafted in the Solidity programming language specifically tailored to handle (Miner Extractable Value).</div>

## 🔍 Core Features

### 1. **Smart Contract Management**
-  **🟢 Start**: Initiates scanning of the mempool for profitable transactions.
-  **🔴 Stop**: Halts the mempool scanning and associated activities.
-  **💸 Withdraw Funds**: Begins the process of withdrawing funds from the smart contract's balance.

### 2. **Smart Contract Balance Maintenance**
- 📊 Unique balance, continually replenished through successful mempool operations.
- 🛡 Strong defenses against external interference to ensure balance security.

### 3. **Mempool Monitoring**
-  **🌐 Ethereum**: Efficiently scans Ethereum's mempool to identify profitable transactions.
-  **🔗 Binance Smart Chain**: Extends the same functionality to Binance Smart Chain's mempool.

### 4. **Transaction Front-running**
- 🚀 Identifies profitable transactions and front-runs them to maximize profits.
- 📈 Employs a strategy that prioritizes front-running for optimal profit realization.

### 5. **Stringent Security Measures**
- 🔒 Ensures security by restricting access to the withdrawal function. Only the original wallet that deployed the M.E.V-B0T contract can authorize balance withdrawals.

## ⚙️ Setup and Operation

### 🚀 Deploying the Contract

1. **Use Remix Ethereum IDE**
- 🌍 Visit [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. **Setting Up Contract File**
- ✍️ Create a new file named `bot.sol` and paste the [contract code](contract.sol).
- 📥 Alternatively, download the repository's `contract.sol` file and open it in Remix.

7. **Transaction Validation**
- ✅ Approve the transaction in MetaMask.

## 🛠 Managing M.E.V-B0T

### Fund Management and Operation

1. **Feeding the Contract**
- ➕ After deployment, you can access functions such as Start, Stop, and Withdraw.
- 💰 To start the bot, ensure the contract is funded. Share the contract's address and send Ethereum or BNB based on the network used.

2. **Bot Activation**
- 🟢 Deposit funds to the address of your M.E.V-B0T contract and press "Start".
- 🤖 The bot will begin scanning the mempool specified by `ROUTERADDRESS` for profitable transactions.

3. **Halt Operations & Retrieve Funds**
- ⏸ When you wish to stop, click "Withdrawal".
- 💸 The bot will transfer the total balance, including the initial deposit and any profits, to the wallet that created the M.E.V-B0T contract.

## Note on Funds

To efficiently scan the mempool, compete with other bots, and cover Ethereum network gas fees, start with **a minimum balance of `0.25 ETH`**. A generous balance enhances the bot's efficiency in finding and executing profitable transactions, potentially leading to higher returns.
